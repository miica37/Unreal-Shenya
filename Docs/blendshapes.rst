Morph Targets (Blendshapes)
###############################

Meshes with Blendshapes Data
============================

Only the Head (which consists of the Eyes, Eyebrows, Eyelashes, Teeths, Tongue and even the Eyes Shadow) contains blendshapes data.

Head
----

The Head has about ~60 morph targets that are created by following the guide on `Apple's ARKit documentation <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/>`_.

Althought I haven't tested it (due to the lack of an Apple Device), it's supposed to work with Unreal's Live Link Face.

Eyes morph together with the eyelids (which is part of the Head), the following morph targets will move the eyes.

Morph Targets Animations
========================
There are two animations with facial (morph targets) animations, they are inside the :abbr:`üìÅAnimations\\FacialExpressions (Content\\Shenya\\Animations\\FacialExpressions)` folder

Anim_facial_expressions_demo
----------------------------
This is the animation used for demo in the youtube video.

|

Anim_smile_blink
----------------
There is no skeletal animation data inside :guilabel:`Anim_smile_blink` so the character is not moving, but it has morph target animation of the character smiling and blinking.

The Addictive Setting for this animation asset is set to Local Space.

You can use :guilabel:`Anim_smile_blink` inside an Animation Blueprint to add facial expressions to existing animations (blending morph target animation to skeletal animation).
