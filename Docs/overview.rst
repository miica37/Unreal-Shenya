Skeleton
========

Shenya Skeleton VS UE4 Mannequin Skeleton:

* Joint Names [:green:`Match`]
* Number of Bones [:green:`Match`] (No extra bones)
* Parent/Child Relationships (Structure) [:green:`Match`]
* Joint Orientations [:orange:`Slightly vary`]
* Proportions [:red:`Different`]

The joint orientation is hand placed so it's not 100% matching but should be pretty close.

Since the body proportion is quite different from UE's mannequin you will need to do some :ref:`retargeting on animations <retarget>`.

Source Fbx Files
================

Source fbx files for Shenya are provided under the folder :abbr:`üìÅContent\\Shenya\\Fbx (Content\\Shenya\\Fbx)`, they can be useful if you would like to make some modification to the character.

These are exported out from **Maya** and imported into Unreal Engine.

The folder's content appears to be empty in Unreal Engine's Content Browser but if you do "Show in Explorer" (open the folder with Windows Explorer or the explorer app of your Operating System), you will see the fbx files.

Blender
-------

One of the issues that you might encounter when exporting mesh out from UE to Blender is the missing shape keys and material slots.

You can use `Fbx Converter <https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-converter-archives>`_ from Autodesk (`as pointed out by TheBasti82 in this Unreal Engine forum thread <https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/export-shape-keys-morph-targets-from-ue4-to-blender-workaround/133040>`_) to convert the fbx files (from UE) before importing them into Blender.

\* However using the provided source fbx files above don't have this problem.

Unreal Engine 5
===============

.. image:: /images/ue5/ue5-viewport.jpg
    :align: center

Shenya is developed on UE 4.22, normally it should work on future versions of Unreal Engine however if you find it misbehave on any later version please report back and I will try to fix them ASAP.

UE4 to UE5 Project Conversion:
    One thing I noticed when opening the preview map in UE5 (and also UE4.27) is it looks much brighter than the same map in UE4. The exposure compensation setting for PostProcessVolume has reverted back to 1.0, so turning it back to 0.0 should line up the looks with UE 4.22.
